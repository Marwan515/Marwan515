# Self-Taught IT Professional | Software Development, Networking, and Cybersecurity Enthusiast

I am a highly motivated and resourceful self-learner with a strong foundation in software development, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Despite not attending traditional schooling, I have demonstrated exceptional resilience and determination, continuously seeking knowledge through online resources, courses, and hands-on experience since 2020. 

I began my journey by self-learning programming and later expanded my skills in networking and cybersecurity. Iâ€™ve broadened my knowledge further through **Cisco NetAcad** and independent study, leveraging platforms like **GitHub**, **freeCodeCamp**, **Stack Overflow**, **LinkedIn Learning**, and online courses from **Harvard University**, **Cognitive Class**, and **Fullstack Open**.

Known for my quick learning ability, attention to detail, and passion for solving technical challenges, I thrive in unstructured learning environments. While I recognize the importance of strong communication skills and am actively working to improve them, I am confident that my technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and dedication to self-improvement enable me to contribute effectively to teams and projects. 

I am eager to apply my skills in real-world environments and contribute to innovative IT solutions.
